<img align="right" src="./docs/shc_walkthrough/3.%20Scan%20Results.png" data-canonical-src="./docs/shc_walkthrough/3.%20Scan%20Results.png" width="350px"/>

Universal Verifiable Credentials Verifier app for Android and iOS using PathCheck's SDKs. The app scans a QR code for a credential/pass, cryptographically verifies it and displays the results on the phone. Our goal is to make a Verifier App with the widest possible verification capabilities.
